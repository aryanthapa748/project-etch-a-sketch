# project-etch-a-sketch
This repository contains code files to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. A browser-based Etch-a-Sketch toy that flexes my DOM manipulation skills in JavaScript! This project allowed me to: Implement CSS Flexbox to display divs as grids, enhancing my layout design skills.
